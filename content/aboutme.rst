My name is Hendrik Schawe. This site is about the achievements of
my short academic career.

I am fascinated by simple models exhibiting an unexpected depth.
Examples, which I studied, are the easily defined
*traveling salesperson problem* turning out to be very hard to
solve; the complex behavior and surprising properties of simple
models, like the *self-avoiding random walks* following fractal paths or
*longest increasing subsequences* showing surprising connections
to random matrix theory and KPZ growth processes. Also
*phase transitions* arising from simple interaction rules spark my
interest, like in the *Ising model* for ferromagnetism
or the *Hegselmann-Krause model* for bounded-confidence
opinion dynamics.

Since simulations are my main tool, I am interested in algorithms
enabling the study of problems which are on the first glance
infeasible, like directly sampling the *large deviation*
regime of an observable with *Markov chain Monte Carlo* methods, finding
exact solutions of moderately sized traveling salesperson instances
using *linear programming* or just pushing the envelope of the system
sizes which can be simulated.
