My name is Hendrik Schawe and I am working
as a postdoc at the LPTM, Universit√© de Cergy-Pontoise.

I am fascinated by simple models exhibiting an unexpected depth.
For example the easily defined *traveling salesperson problem* turning out
to be very hard to solve, the complex behavior of simple models, be
it *networks* or *self-avoiding random walks*, *phase transitions*
arising from simple interaction rules like the *Ising model* or
the length of the *longest increasing subsequence*, whose fluctuations
show surprising connections to random matrix theory and KPZ growth processes.

Currently I am working on models for *opinion dynamics* to obtain a better
understanding how opinion change with time or which mechanisms lead to
patterns observed in society.

Since simulations are my main tool, I am interested in algorithms
which enable me to study problems which are on the first glance
infeasible, like directly sampling the *large deviation*
regime of an observable with *Markov chain Monte Carlo* methods or finding
exact solutions of moderately sized traveling salesperson instances
using *linear programming*.
