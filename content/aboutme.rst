My name is Hendrik Schawe and I am working
as a postdoc at the LPTM, CY Cergy Paris Universit√©.

I am fascinated by simple models exhibiting an unexpected depth.
As examples on which I worked, take the easily defined
*traveling salesperson problem* turning out to be very hard to
solve, the complex behavior and surprising properties of simple
models, be it *self-avoiding random walks* or
*longest increasing subsequences*, or *phase transitions*
arising from simple interaction rules like in the *Ising model*
or the *Hegselmann-Krause model* for bounded confidence
opinion dynamics.

Since simulations are my main tool, I am interested in algorithms
enabling the study of problems which are on the first glance
infeasible, like directly sampling the *large deviation*
regime of an observable with *Monte Carlo* methods or finding
exact solutions of moderately sized traveling salesperson instances
using *linear programming*.

Currently I am working on simple models for opinion dynamics
as well as real world data obtained from a large social network
to obtain a better understanding how opinion change with time
and which mechanisms lead to the patterns observed in society.
