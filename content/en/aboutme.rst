My name is Hendrik Schawe and I am a PhD student
in the `Computational Physics <https://www.uni-oldenburg.de/compphys/>`_
group of the University Oldenburg.

I am fascinated by simple models exhibiting an unexpected depth.
For example the easily defined *traveling salesperson problem* turning out
to be very hard to solve, the complex behavior of simple models, be
it *networks* or *self-avoiding random walks*, *phase transitions*
arising from simple interaction rules like the *Ising model* or the
the length of the *longest increasing subsequence*, whose fluctuations
show surprising connections to random matrix theory and KPZ growth processes.

Since simulations are my main tool, I am interested in algorithms
which enable to study problems, which are on the first glance
infeasible, like directly sampling the *large deviation*
regime of an observable with *Markov chain Monte Carlo* methods or finding
exact solutions of moderately sized traveling salesperson instances
using *linear programming*.
